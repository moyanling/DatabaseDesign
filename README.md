# DatabaseDesign
Build a command line based simple database.<br>
It is required that data is stored in binary representation.<br>


It's going to support following commands:<br>
• SHOW SCHEMAS – Displays all schemas defined in your database.<br>
• USE – Chooses a schema.<br>
• SHOW TABLES – Displays all tables in the currently chosen schema.<br>
• CREATE SCHEMA – Creates a new schema to hold tables.<br>
• CREATE TABLE – Creates a new table schema, i.e. a new empty table.<br>
• INSERT INTO TABLE – Inserts a row/record into a table.<br>
• DROP TABLE – Remove a table schema, and all of its contained data.<br>
• “SELECT-FROM-WHERE” -style query<br>
• EXIT – Cleanly exits the program and saves all table and index information in non-volatile files.<br>
